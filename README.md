credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)

indexing_service = build("indexing", "v3", credentials=credentials)

def publish_url(url):
    body = {
        "url": url,
        "type": "URL_UPDATED"
    }
    response = indexing_service.urlNotifications().publish(body=body).execute()
    print(response)
```
